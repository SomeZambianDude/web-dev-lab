In this lab, we set up our web development environment by installing essential tools, creating a basic web page, and learning version control with Git and GitHub.

Our Key Tasks were:
✅ Installing VS Code, Git, and Node.js
✅ Creating and opening a basic HTML file in a browser
✅ And then initializing a Git repository and pushing its code to GitHub
