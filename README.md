In this lab, I set up my web development environment by installing VS Code, Git, and Node.js. I then created a basic HTML webpage and viewed it in a browser. After configuring Git and GitHub, I initialized a repository, committed my code, and pushed it to GitHub. I also completed Git workflow tasks, including branching and pull requests.
